# Simple Video Search Engine App build using React
- Build while following the course [React-Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).
- App makes use of the Youtube API to display videos.

### Aim
- Aim of this project was to get a basic understanding of React.
- Redux has not been applied in this application.
- Little effort has been put into styling, as the main aim of this project was to learn more about React.
- Notes in relation to this project can be found throughout my [React cheatsheet folder](https://github.com/silksil/best-practices-cheatsheets/tree/master/client/react).
